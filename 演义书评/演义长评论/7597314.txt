note

        Few things in this book made me think. 1. it's sad and stupid that a really intelligent person serve a narrow minded, short sighted employer. There are so many examples in this book proved it. This also made me think it is a universal rule works in marriage and business. 2. Book also showed how those not the smartest people,who can attract all kinds of talented ones working for him. This kind of people not only exist in fiction or thousand years ago history, it also happened nowadays and everywhere. My question is how to be this kind of person that can make the smartest person willing to work for you and respect you? 3. The relationship between winners and losers in this book is very complicated. They want to kill each other, also willing to cooperate, even  respect and admire each other. That's why when Cao die, or Zhu Gelling die, their enemies are tearing also feel relieved a little. Their relationship mixed with love and hate. It's true in real life now too. Relationship between Steve Jobs and Bill Gates is a example. 4. This book is funny and humorous. Specially when it is about ghost or religious examples in this book are great and funny story. I love it. <br><br>A book can make me think a lot about some questions, is a good book.<br><br>1. how can I do not be the one are stupid, short sighted, emotional, self inflated person? <br><br>2. How can some of people in this book are so brave and loyal? What makes them so fearless? Maybe because they love doing what they do?<br>Like Guan Gong, he always be the first to stand out and ready to fight. It makes me believe that he loves to fight so much , so he doesn't know what is fear. Maybe he will be miserable if he is not in the war fighting with someone. <br><br>3. Why someone is so excellent but die early? Is that a bad thing? <br><br>4. Life  involves in politics doesn't sound attractive to me.
